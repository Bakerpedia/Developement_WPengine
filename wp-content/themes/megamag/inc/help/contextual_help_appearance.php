<b>Skins</b><br>

<br>
Remember to hit the save button for the changes to take effect.<br>

<b>Color settings</b><br>
Here you can change the individual properties that define the appearance.<br>
<br>
Layour style:<br>
<b>boxed</b>: header and menu are contained within a boxed layout.<br>
<b>full width</b>: header and menu span the entire width of the page while the main content is displayed centered and boxed.<br>
<br>
Color settings note: Main color and Rating bar color usually looks best if they are kept the same. If you leave the Rating bar color empty<br>
the Main color will be used automatically. If you however wish for the two colors to be different from each other you can define<br>
individual colors for each.<br>
</p>

<p>
<b>Box shadows</b><br>
Choose if you want to show shadows around the main container boxes (header, nav-bar, main content and footer).
</p>

<p>
<b>Background settings</b><br>
Choose your background.<br>
<br>
You can either choose a pattern or you can upload your own custom background image. <br>
If a custom background image is uploaded the default pattern/image will not be used. <br>
To use one of the predefined patterns / images simply leave the URL text field empty.<br>
<br>
Notice: Some of the background patterns are semi-transparent and will show better on a light background (body background color).<br>

<b>Category backgrounds</b><br>
You can choose a different background image for each category.<br>
<br>
The category background image will be displayed on single posts with the given category and also on the category archive page.<br>
