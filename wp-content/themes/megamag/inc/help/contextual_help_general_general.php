<b> &#149; Replace header box</b>

<p>
	The header box contains the logo and optionally the header banner.<br>
	You can remove this and replace it with an image instead.<br>
	<br>
	<i>For boxed version</i> your image will be resized to 980 pixels in width.<br>
	<i>For full width version</i> your image will not be resized but it is recommended that you use images of 1920 pixels or more in size.<br>
</p>

<b> &#149; Logo URL</b>

<b> &#149; Header banner code</b>

<p>
	This is the code responsible for displaying the banner located in the header area. Usually in the form of &lt;img src="thepath/thefilename.jpg"&gt;. If no input the default_header_banner.jpg will be displayed (size: 468x60px)
</p>

<b> &#149; Logo URL</b>

<p>
	Complete URL to your logo. You can choose to upload a new image and use that as your logo. Click on the "Upload logo" button. Choose an image and be sure to click the "Use as logo" button. 
	The image will be uploaded to your media library and you can edit or delete it through the Media menu. You can also insert a URL manually in the text field. 
	If you wish to use an image you have already uploaded to your media library go to the Media menu, choose your image and copy the File URL into the Logo URL text field. 
	If you leave the text field empty the default logo will be displayed.
</p>

<b>  &#149; Favicon URL</b>

<p>
Works like the Logo URL. Either insert a URL manually or use the upload function. You can edit or delete the favicon using the Media menu. Leave the text field blank to use the default favicon.</p>

<b> &#149; Use responsive design</b>

<p>
	Responsive design changes the way your site looks depending on the browser size. This is done to optimize the viewing experience on different devices. The MegaMag theme supports 4 browser sizes which are roughly: Normal computer screen, tablet horizontal, tablet vertical and mobile phone.<br>
	<br>
	Turning off the responsive design will make the site look the same across all devices and browser sizes.<br>
