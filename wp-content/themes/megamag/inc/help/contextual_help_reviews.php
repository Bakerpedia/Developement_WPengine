<b>Rating labels</b><br>
You can choose to attach a word to your overall score. This will be displayed in the review box on your review posts as a one-word verdict.<br>
<br>
You can have 11 different words attached to your rating scale.<br>
You don't have to fill out all 11 words.<br>
Your overall score will display the word associated with the nearest lowest step on the scale.<br>
<br>
E.g. using the default settings:<br>
A score of 40% on your custom scale (e.g. 4/10) will display the verdict: average.<br>
A score of 58% on your custom scale (e.g. 5.8/10) will display the verdict: average.<br>
A score of 60% on your custom scale (e.g. 6/10) will display the verdict: good.<br>
<br>
Notice that each step is a percentage step. This is to accommodate many different rating scales.<br>
E.g. 60% is equal to:<br>
the score of 6 on a 10 scale.<br>
the score of 60 on a 100 scale.<br>
the score of 3 on a 5 scale.<br>
